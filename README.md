# Image-Noise-Reduction-with-Deep-Convolutional-Autoencoders


In this project, we explore the use of autoencoders for reducing noise in images using different encoder filter sizes.

Autoencoders are neural networks that can be trained to reconstruct their input data. By using an encoder to compress the input data into a lower-dimensional representation, and a decoder to reconstruct the original data from the compressed representation, autoencoders can effectively learn a compressed representation of the input data.

In this project, we use autoencoders to reduce noise in images by training them on noisy images and their corresponding clean images. We experiment with different encoder filter sizes, including 16x16, 32x32, and 64x64, to explore how the size of the filters affects the performance of the autoencoder.

Our repository contains the code for training and testing the autoencoder, as well as the datasets used in the experiments. We also provide pre-trained models, so you can easily test the performance of the autoencoder on your own images.
